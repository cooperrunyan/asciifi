## Inspiration

This most certainly has been done before, I am not taking credit for an original
idea. The inspiration came from a video posted by Fireship on YouTube in 2020.
He went over some cool app ideas, one of them being an ascii image converter. In
the video, he explained that anyone can use the app idea, as long as they
provide credit.
